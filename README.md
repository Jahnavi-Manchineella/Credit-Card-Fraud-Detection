# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various data analysis and classification techniques. It is based on a dataset of real-world transactions and demonstrates how to handle imbalanced datasets, apply preprocessing, and evaluate classification performance.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

It presents transactions that occurred over two days, where 492 out of 284,807 transactions are fraudulent.

Imbalance: The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172%.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook
Download or clone this repository.

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb
Execute the cells to follow the analysis.

📈 Results
The models were evaluated based on their ability to correctly identify fraud while minimizing false positives. Metrics such as Precision, Recall, and AUC Score are used to compare model performance.

🧠 Key Learnings
Fraud detection requires handling imbalanced datasets carefully.

Ensemble methods (like Random Forest or XGBoost) can provide robust performance.

Precision-Recall trade-off is critical in fraud detection systems.

📌 To Do
Integrate with a real-time detection pipeline.

Use deep learning models for improved accuracy.

Deploy model as an API using Flask or FastAPI.
